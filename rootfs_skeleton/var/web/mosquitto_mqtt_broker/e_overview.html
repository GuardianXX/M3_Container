<h3>Mosquitto MQTT-Broker</h3>
This is a demonstration container running in the SmartBox of MRX routers. It is provided by INSYS icom on the base of existing 3<sup>rd</sup> party software especially the MQTT broker Mosquitto. 
MQTT is one of the leading protocols for the IoT (Internet of Things) as its publisher-subscriber architecture realises the necessary information flow without polling in slim and reliable way.
Within the MQTT architecture the broker accepts topics with values from publishes and forwards them to subscribers registered for these.<br><br>

Publisher and subscriber need to establish TCP/IP connections to the broker. The routers networking capabilities (e.g. OpenVPN over INSYS Connectivity Service) can support the network accessibility. 
To operate this showcase you need
<ul>
<li>an MQTT publisher (e.g. Monitoring App on INSYS OS routers or demo container Modbus MQTT gateway for MRX SmartBox) as a data source</li>
<li>an MQTT subscriber application running on a PC or smartphone (see recommendations on <a href="http://www.hivemq.com/blog/seven-best-mqtt-client-tools">HiveMQ/Clients</a>) to display the values</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li>The bind address is used to restrict the access and may remain empty for demonstration purposes.</li>
<li>The TCP port is the target port for connection from publishers and subscribers. Default ports are 1883 and 8883 (for TLS).</li>
<li>The IP address of the container itself as the target address for connection from publishers and subscribers is managed in the router's menu Administration/Container</li>
</ul>
<strong>Beware:</strong> Changes of the configuration take effect only after clicking on <q>activate settings</q> in the headline.
<h3>Demonstration Container</h3>
INSYS icom provides this demonstration container <q>as is</q> with no guarantee of any function. It is not maintained by INSYS.
This container makes use of 3<sup>rd</sup> party software whose licence rights must be respected.
This is a demonstration container with the only purpose to show how existing technologies may be used with a SmartBox container of an MRX router. 
<em>This demonstration container is not designed to be operated in a productive environment.</em>
Insight to this container is given for further investigation and changes in two ways:
<ul>
<li>Command line access by ssh is granted for the user <em>root</em> with the password <em>root</em>. You can check and change anything within the running container.</li>
<li>The container with all its available sources is published on the public project pages on <a href="https://github.com/insys-icom/m3_container">Github</a>.</li>
</ul>
